00:00:21   Introducing brilliant integrative thinker Daniel Schmachtenberger
00:02:54   Finding meaning in the sacred dimensions of our world and the integrated wholeness of reality
00:04:46   Part of love is the desire to know everything about your partner—when loving reality, everything becomes interesting
00:06:37   The fractal nature of reality, looking at it through different lenses and receiving different insights, and how the more perspectives you take, the more depth and richness you perceive
00:08:18   Is there something about the nature of the effort to solve world problems that is at fault in their getting worse?
00:10:30   Daniel’s homeschooling parents set him on the path to following what is good, meaningful, and beautiful right from the start
00:12:38   If you facilitate children’s interest, they end up deep learning in many subjects
00:15:00   Daniel’s early education included systems theory and how to make a better world
00:16:57   How did Daniel come to be such an integrative thinker? Compartmentalized education vs integrated education
00:20:54   The decline of quality aristocratic tutoring has led to the decline of super geniuses
00:28:41   Are we all the result of our education? Tutors and mentors
00:30:48   Integrating across ontology and epistemology, and asking what is the generator function of novel insight?
00:35:36   Man’s greatest purpose is to serve the family of man: women, nature, children
00:37:40   The gruesome deficit of fathering in the world and what Daniel learned about being a man from his dad
00:46:29   On forgiveness, therapy, healing, catalyzing gifts
00:54:15   How do spiritual depths inform our contemporary crises? Needing to ask why we should protect nature shows a real pathological deficit
00:58:00   Orientation to the sacred and the meaningfulness of life forms through a deep bandwidth of connection and sensing
01:01:31   Learning more about the field of conceptuality can both interfere with one’s connection to the Tao and enhance it
01:04:40   Does Daniel believe in God?
01:11:44   In Daniel’s “The Dance of the Tao and the 10,000 Things,” he asks, “Do atoms exist?" Kind of!
01:14:39   The traps of reductionism in facing the metacrisis and how Daniel transcends them
01:17:24   The relation of physical crises to crises of consciousness: co-informing and co-arising facets of an integrative reality
01:21:18   Omni determinism, omni influence
01:22:20   Marvin Harris’ framework for understanding civilization: infrastructure, social structure, and superstructure
01:24:06   What in the interiority of human psyches, experiences &amp; cultures are key drivers of the problems of the world? And how does our changed human genome, microbiome, and neurochemistry fit in?
01:27:11   We evolved to have attachments to 150 people—our tribe—so everything about bonding, attachment theory, the ideas of co-dependence &amp; interdependence evolved in a tribal setting, in fact, we did not evolve to deal with what is going on now
01:29:20   The psychological generator function of the metacrisis results from perceiving the world as fragmented or made up of parts: conflict theory &amp; mistake theory
01:31:40   The Realpolitik assessment of humans: we are dumb and nasty
01:33:21   It’s all based on a trade-off—we’re either trying to benefit ourselves now at the expense of our future selves, individually or collectively, or we just don’t realize the harm that is caused by what we do
01:36:15   Can we survive the current unprecedented metacrisis? No chance can we make it through without the catastrophes intensifying
01:41:44   The human family is not a real thing right now: there is no “we”
01:44:53   How to live a meaningful life? Deeply appreciate and honor the beauty of life, be in service to the beauty of reality, and deepen the capacity for both
01:49:20   Dharma inquiry and the vow of the bodhisattva
01:51:37   Where is the vow of the bodhisattva missing something?
01:54:40   It’s not just what is my unique calling but also what needs doing that no one else wants to do?
01:58:07   One beautiful peak experience is worth all the pain

      <title>Чистота понимания: В поисках утраченного времени. Павел Щелин, Алексей Чадаев, Семён Уралов</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA0ekBbCt_A</link>
      <description>«Чистота понимания» – авторский подкаст философа и военно-политического технолога Алексея Чадаева и медиатехнолога и писателя Семёна Уралова, модератор беседы – журналист Иван Князев.
Вместе с приглашенными экспертами авторы подкаста разбираются в сложных вопросах, с которыми каждый человек сталкивается ежедневно, обсуждают острые и актуальные события вокруг, вникают в тонкости и нюансы всех процессов. 

Тема выпуска: В поисках утраченного времени.

У нас в гостях – политолог и философ Павел Щелин.

В этом выпуске мы обсудили феномен времени — как изменилось наше восприятие скорости и почему современность требует мгновенных решений.

Разобрали, почему власть — это не только способность ускорять, но и умение тормозить, а также как когнитивные войны превращают время в оружие.

Приятного просмотра!

Playing as the POPE in EU5 is simply DIVINE!

      <title>Russia and the West: From Interest to Misunderstanding</title>
      <link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB8SerWxGPA</link>
      <description>This panel is part of a half-day programme starring Prof. Jacques Sapir, alongside the following panel “Unknown Knowns: The Euro After 25 Years: Builder or Gravedigger of Europe?”

French economist Jacques Sapir, widely regarded as one of France’s leading specialist on Russia, will examine how mutual interest between Russia and the West gave way to lasting misunderstanding. A long-time critic of what he calls the West’s “autistic” reading of Russia, Sapir argues that European and American policymakers have misjudged the country’s economic resilience and strategic logic. He contends that sanctions and isolation have produced counterproductive “boomerang effects,” strengthening Russia’s autonomy while straining Western economies. Drawing on decades of research, Sapir will offer a nuanced, data-driven perspective on how the current impasse emerged—and whether a path to renewed dialogue remains possible.

The presentation will be followed by a panel discussion, including:

Philip Pilkington, a macroeconomist and Visiting Research Fellow at the Danube Institute, as co-panelist
Hugo Martin, also a Visiting Research Fellow at the Danube Institute, as moderator
Biography

Jacques Sapir is a French economist and internationally recognized specialist on Russia and economic theory. A graduate of Sciences Po Paris and later Director of Studies at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), he has devoted much of his research to the Soviet and post-Soviet economy, the dynamics of industrialization, and the challenges of economic transition. He has taught at leading institutions in France, Russia, and the United States, and is a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Widely published, Sapir has authored influential works on macroeconomic theory, globalization, monetary integration, and the future of the euro, including Les trous noirs de la science économique (2000), La fin de l’euro-libéralisme (2006), and most recently La Fin de l’Ordre Occidental?
